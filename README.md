# Readable APP

This is a simple reddit clone, based on the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. 
Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. 
Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes 
* a simple backend API Server in the `api-server` subdir
* the frontend which contains the actual app (created using create-react-app) in the `frontend` subdir

## Start developing / using the App

To get started:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the app
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
